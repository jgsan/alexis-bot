userlog-optout-details: >
  This command allows you to opt-out from your user data being logged. But what
  data? That sounds scary.

  Well, Discord needs some bots to follow this requirement, but this bot does not
  actually store any of your personal data. When it says data, it means some
  information we display to server staff. This information is normally logged to
  a hidden channel for staff members. The information provided to them is:

  ```
    - When you change your username and we display a list of your previous usernames.

    - When you edit or remove your messages on servers.
  ```

  You can opt-out from this information being logged by sending `$CMD yes`.
userlog-optout-confirm: Please use "$CMD yes" to opt out.
userlog-optout-done: You opted-out from being logged.
