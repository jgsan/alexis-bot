  Hi! I'm AlexisBot, made by some folks in Chile. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±


  Use them with the prefix **`$PX` + "command"** in any chat I can answer. If
  the command starts with `$PX`, you must type the prefix twice. For more
  information about the command, use `$CMD <command>`.


  If you want to opt-out from your data being logged, use the `$PXoptout` command.
